# Chez Soop

This repo packages up a fork Chez SOOP to be used with [akku](https://akkuscm.org/).

SOOP can be found [here.](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/blob/master/mats/oop.ss)
and its tests, [here](https://github.com/cisco/ChezScheme/blob/master/mats/oop.ms)

I claim no authorship over these files, and have inherited the Apache-2.0 license these files are licensed under.

The only change has been to use the suggested name, "SOOP", and the library import `(soop)` for the library.
